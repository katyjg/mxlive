Mail-In data collections are typically completed within about one week, but may occasionally take longer.  Appropriate priorities should be assigned in MxLIVE to experiments that are urgent.  Images and reports can be accessed via MxLIVE as soon as they have been collected, and a report will be sent by e-mail once your Mail-In is complete.

Several days prior to your beamtime, please provide your local contact with a phone number where you can be reached during your beamtime, as well as a list of personnel that will be operating the beamline remotely.  Anyone operating the beamline must make arrangements ahead of time to complete a Remote Beamline Specific Orientation (if they have not already done so) and should review the remote connection and training information:
