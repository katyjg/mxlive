<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Hello and welcome to the CMCF LIMS. The LIMS is a web application 
for managing sample, shipping and experiment information related to macromolecular 
crystallography experiments at the Canadian Light Source, Inc. It will assists 
you to prepare crystal samples for shipping to the CLS, request experiments to 
be performed automatically on those samples, manage experimental parameters, 
inspect and download results and data, all from a single location.</p>
<p>The LIMS is divided into the following sections:</p>
<dl>
<dt>&ldquo;Samples&rdquo;</dt>
<dd>This tab provides tools for dealing with crystals you are preparing, their contents and associated hazard information.<br/>
</dd>
<dt>&ldquo;Experiments&rdquo;</dt>
<dd>This tab provides tools for creating experimental requests and associating requests with crystals. It also provides tools for viewing results of already performed experiments.<br/>
</dd>
<dt>&ldquo;Shipping&rdquo;</dt>
<dd>This tab provides tools for organizing samples you intend to send to the sychrotron in Containers, Dewars, and Shipments.<br/>
</dd>

<h2>Samples</h2>
<p>
This section provides tools for dealing with crystals you are preparing, their contents and associated hazard information. 
</p>
<p>This section divided into the following sub-sections:</p>
<dl>
<dt>&ldquo;Constituents&rdquo;</dt>
<dd>A constituent is the smallest component of your sample for which you would like to provide hazard information. This could be a protein, salt, buffer, organic molecule or precipipant. You need at least one constituent to be able to create Cocktails. Examples of Constituents could be "Ammonium Sulphate", "PEG 4000", "Tris-HCL", "Lysozyme" etc.<br/>
</dd>
<dt>&ldquo;Cocktails&rdquo;</dt>
<dd>A cocktail is a mixture of of constituent which makes up a crystal sample. For example, a typical crystal is made up of "protein", "precipitant" and "buffer" constituents. A cocktail can consist of any number of constituents (at least one) and a constituent can be part of any number of cocktails. Each crystal should have a cocktail.<br/>
</dd> 
<dt>&ldquo;Crystal Forms&rdquo;</dt>
<dd>A crystal form contains information about the lattice symmetry, space/point group and cell dimensions for a crystal sample. <br/>
</dd>
<dt>&ldquo;Crystals&rdquo;</dt>
<dd>In the context of the LIMS, a crystal represents a mounted crystal in a loop. Idealy, a crystal should have a cocktail associated with it as well as a Crystal-Form. Crystals can optionally also be associated with sample containers.<br/>

<blockquote>
<i>Although this LIMS is designed to protect your private information, you are not required to provide information you would rather keep private. You can always replace names with code-words which make sense only to you. The only requirement is for you to provide accurate hazard information for the contents of the crystal.</i></blockquote>

<h2>Shipping</h2>
<p>
This section provides tools for organizing samples you intend to send to the sychrotron in Containers, Dewars, and Shipments. This section divided into the following sub-sections:</p>
<dl>
<dt>&ldquo;Containers&rdquo;</dt>
<dd>
A "container" where frozen crystals are stored. A container can be one of several types, "Cane", "Cassette", or "Uni-Puck". Each container type has predefined capacities. For example, a Puck can store up to 16 samples, a Cassette can store up to 96 samples and a cane can store up to 6 samples. A crystal can be part of only one container at a given moment, although it can always be reassigned from one container to another.<br/>
For each container, the sample positions must be unique and within certain allowed ranges as determined by the container. For example, Cassette sample positions must be two characters long of the format "[A-L][1-8]" ("A1" to "L8"). For the other container types, sample positions are simply integers. For canes, sample positions are numbered from the bottom starting at 1.<br/>
</dd>
<dt>&ldquo;Dewars&rdquo;</dt>
<dd>Here you define shipping dewars. A dewar can contain any number of containers. However, a container can be part of only one shipment at a given moment.<br/>
</dd> 
<dt>&ldquo;Shipment&rdquo;</dt>
<dd>A shipment is made up of one or more dewars being sent to the synchrotron. A dewar can be part of only one shipment at a given moment. Once a shipment is created it will exist in the system in the "Draft" state until sent to the CLS at which point it the state becomes "Out-going". The normal life-cycle of a shipment is "Draft" &rarr; "Out-going" &rarr; "Received" &rarr; "In-coming" &rarr; "Closed". Only "Draft" shipments can be edited.<br/>

<h2>Experiments</h2>
<p>
This section provides tools for creating experimental requests and associating requests with crystals. It also provides tools for viewing and verifying results of already performed experiments.
</p>
<p>This section divided into the following sub-sections:</p>
<dl>
<dt>&ldquo;Experiment Requests&rdquo;</dt>
<dd>An Experiment request or simply 'experiment' contains information about the type of experiment requested, the desired and acceptable quality of results expected from the samples and the plan to employ. An experiment request can be any number of samples (at least one). Every experiment is performed in two stages "Screening" and "Data acquisition". The "Screening" stage generates parameters to be used during data acquisition. The experiment type and plan determines how the experiment is performed. <br/>
<dl><dt>Experiment Types:</dt>
<dd>
    <i>MAD</i> &ndash; Excitation and Edge Fluorescence scans will be performed during screening. Data collection strategy will be performed for anomalous data using 3 wavelengths. <br/>
    <i>SAD</i> &ndash; Excitation and Edge Fluorescence scans will be performed during screening. Data collection strategy will be performed for anomalous data using the peak wavelength.<br/>
    <i>Native</i> &ndash; A routine screening will be performed and data collection strategy will be calculated for non-anomalous data. No flourescence scans will be performed.<br/>
</dd> 
<dt>Experiment Plans:</dt>
<dd>
    <i>Screen and Collect</i> &ndash; Samples will be screened and data immediately collected on each one using automatically determined strategy without intervention.<br/>
    <i>Screen and Confirm</i> &ndash; Samples will be screened and the screening results and calculated strategy presented to the user for confirmation or modification. Further processing of the samples in this experiment will be halted until confirmation is received.<br/>
    <i>Collect first OK sample</i> &ndash; Samples will be screened in the order determined by the crystal priority. Data will be automatically collected for the first crystal found to pass the constraints of desirability specified in the experiment. The remaining samples associated with this experiment will not be processed further under this experiment.<br/>
    <i>Rank and Collect best</i> &ndash; Samples will be screened and ranked according to quality. Data will be immediately collected on only the best sample using the automatically determined strategy without intervention. <br/>
    <i>Rank and Confirm</i> &ndash; Samples will be screened and ranked according to quality. The screening results and calculated strategy presented to the user for confirmation or modification. Further processing of the samples in this experiment will be halted until confirmation is received.<br/>
