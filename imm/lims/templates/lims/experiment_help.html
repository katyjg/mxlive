This section provides tools for creating experimental requests and associating requests with crystals. It also provides tools for viewing and verifying results of already performed experiments.
</p>
<p>This section divided into the following sub-sections:</p>
<dl>
<dt>&ldquo;Experiment Requests&rdquo;</dt>
<dd>An Experiment request or simply 'experiment' contains information about the type of experiment requested, the desired and acceptable quality of results expected from the samples and the plan to employ. An experiment request can be any number of samples (at least one). Every experiment is performed in two stages "Screening" and "Data acquisition". The "Screening" stage generates parameters to be used during data acquisition. The experiment type and plan determines how the experiment is performed. <br/>
<dl><dt>Experiment Types:</dt>
<dd>
    <i>MAD</i> &ndash; Excitation and Edge Fluorescence scans will be performed during screening. Data collection strategy will be performed for anomalous data using 3 wavelengths. <br/>
    <i>SAD</i> &ndash; Excitation and Edge Fluorescence scans will be performed during screening. Data collection strategy will be performed for anomalous data using the peak wavelength.<br/>
    <i>Native</i> &ndash; A routine screening will be performed and data collection strategy will be calculated for non-anomalous data. No flourescence scans will be performed.<br/>
</dd> 
<dt>Experiment Plans:</dt>
<dd>
    <i>Screen and Collect</i> &ndash; Samples will be screened and data immediately collected on each one using automatically determined strategy without intervention.<br/>
    <i>Screen and Confirm</i> &ndash; Samples will be screened and the screening results and calculated strategy presented to the user for confirmation or modification. Further processing of the samples in this experiment will be halted until confirmation is received.<br/>
    <i>Collect first OK sample</i> &ndash; Samples will be screened in the order determined by the crystal priority. Data will be automatically collected for the first crystal found to pass the constraints of desirability specified in the experiment. The remaining samples associated with this experiment will not be processed further under this experiment.<br/>
    <i>Rank and Collect best</i> &ndash; Samples will be screened and ranked according to quality. Data will be immediately collected on only the best sample using the automatically determined strategy without intervention. <br/>
    <i>Rank and Confirm</i> &ndash; Samples will be screened and ranked according to quality. The screening results and calculated strategy presented to the user for confirmation or modification. Further processing of the samples in this experiment will be halted until confirmation is received.<br/>
