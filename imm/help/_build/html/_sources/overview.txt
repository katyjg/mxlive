Overview

The CMCF LIMS is a Laboratory Information Management System for managing sample, 
shipping and experiment information related to macromolecular crystallography 
experiments at the Canadian Light Source, Inc. It will assists you to prepare 
crystal samples for shipping to the CLS, request experiments to be performed 
on those samples, manage experimental parameters, inspect and download results 
and data, all from a single location.

The LIMS is divided into the following sections:

    - Samples:  This section provides tools for dealing with crystals you are preparing, 
      their contents and associated hazard information.  
      
    - Shipping: This section provides tools for organizing samples you intend to 
      send to the sychrotron in Containers, Dewars, and Shipments.
    
    - Experiments: This section provides tools for creating experimental requests 
      and associating requests with crystals. It also provides tools for viewing 
      results of already performed experiments, and processed data. 

Access to the LIMS is via a secure web-site.

LIMS Entities
-------------

The following entities can be viewed or managed within the LIMS:

    - Crystals: Refers to a frozen crystal on a pin ready for a diffraction experiment.
    
    - Protein Cocktails: Contains information about the contents of the crystallization drop. 
      Each crystal may be associated with a cocktail and multiple crystals can be 
      associated to the same cocktail. It is not a required to specify a cocktail
      although it is highly recommended since the cocktail also contains harzard information
      about the sample.
    
    - Crystal-forms: Contains information about the cell dimensions, and space group. 
      Each crystal may be associated with a crystal-form and multiple crystals can be 
      associated to a single crystal-form. It is not a necessary to specify a crystal-form
      although it is recommended if the cell parameters and or space group is known.
      Once entered, crystal-forms can be reused later.
    
    - Containers: Can be a Universal Container (Uni-Puck), SSRL Cassette, or Cane.
    
    - Dewars: A dry-shipper which can contain one or more containers
    
    - Shipments: A collection of one or more dewars being sent to the synchrotron.
    
    - Experiment Requests: An experiment request is an instruction with a set of parameters governing
      how the samples associated with the request should be processed once at the facility. Each crystal
      can and must be assigned to one and only one experiment. If no experiment is specified, it will
      be interpreted as an instruction to screen and collect data on the crystal.
    
    - Data sets: A set of images collected either for Screening or Data Collection together
      with their meta-data such as beamline and beamline settings when the data were collected.
      Data sets are generated by the beamline software and uploaded to the LIMS. Users can only view but 
      not create or edit datasets within the LIMS.
    
    - Processing Reports: This is the result of automated data processing with AutoProcess. 
      Reports are generated by the beamline software and uploaded to the LIMS. Users can can only view but 
      not create or edit processing reports within the LIMS.
