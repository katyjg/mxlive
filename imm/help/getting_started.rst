Supported Browsers
==================

The MxLIVE is a rich web application which makes use of the lates web 
technologies such as Javascript, CSS and AJAX to provide an intuitive user
experience. Therefore it is not expected that outdated browsers will work. 
MxLIVE has been tested and certified to work properly using Firefox >= 3.6, 
Chrome >= 9, Safari >= 5.0.1. It will work in Internet Explorer >= 7 but with 
a somewhat diminished user-experience. We therefore recommend that users
download and install either Firefox, Chrome or Safari, which are freely available 
for most operating systems. 

.. _access-authentication:

Access and Authentication
=========================

To access the login page of MxLIVE, point your browser to::

    https://cmcf.lightsource.ca/
    
Note that the protocol should be specified as ``https://`` and not ``http://``. The latter will
take you to our public website, rather than the secure MxLIVE website.

In order to login to MxLIVE, you need an account in the beamline LDAP authentication system. 
This account is the same one you will use to access the beamline computers. If you do not yet
have an account, or have forgotten your credentials, or if for any reason you are
unable to login, please contact beamline staff.
