Datasets & Reports
==================
Data objects store meta-data about datasets collected on the beamline, and reference files stored on a file server.

Data and Reports are uploaded directly from the beamline as they are completed. Full lists of your Datasets and Reports
are available under the Search item in the header navigation menu. Those lists can be filtered by date and the  type of
dataset or report.

Downloads
---------
You can download individual frames from a dataset, complete datasets, full report directories (including all files
contained within), or even full session directories containing all datasets and reports created in that session.
