    Detailed lists of Shipments, Containers, Groups, Samples, Datasets, Reports, Sessions, and Activity

Detailed lists give you access to a full record of your activity in MxLIVE. Even after dataset and report files have
been removed from beamline data storage (as storage limits require), meta-data remains in MxLIVE in perpetuity.

Each list has a set of filters available, along with a search box to quickly find what you are looking for.

Clicking on an entry in the list will either take you to a separate page or a modal window with more details.

          is draft shipments, which are only accessible by you, and become visible to staff once they have been sent.
