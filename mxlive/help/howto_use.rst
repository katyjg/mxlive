Adding Entries
---------------

Information about your crystals can be added to MxLIVE in two different ways:

    *By uploading a spreadsheet*
        This is the most convenient way of adding crystal information if you have already previously
        frozen your samples and filled out the standard spreadheet template downloadable from the
        project home page. 
        
        #. Click the "Upload" tool-icon on the project homem page. A form will be presented to enable
           uploading of your filled spreadsheet.                          
        #. Browse your file system and select the previously filled spreadsheet, adjust the Shipment 
           and Dewar names as desired and click the Upload button to upload the information. The system
           will create entries for the Crystals, Cocktails, Containers, Crystal Forms and Experiment request 
           groups defined within the spreadsheet and associate them with a single Dewar and Shipment.                     
        #. If you need a different arrangment such as multiple dewars or shipments, make sure you 
           manually rearrage the entries as you see fit after uploading before sending the information.

    
    *By Clicking the 'Add' tool-icon*
        This is probably the most common way of adding one or a few entries. Clicking the tool will 
        present a form for adding new entries. This form is also available from the sidebar of entries 
        which can "contain" other entries, such as Containers, Dewars, Shipments and Experiment requests. 
        
        In all forms, required fields have a red asterix next to the field names. Those fields indicate
        the minimum information required to create a new entry. However, please always provide as much information
        as possible. Where default values have been specified, make sure they make sense for your specific case
        and edit them if that is not the case. 
        
        Often, a new form will present fields for associating the newly created entry with other entries such
        as Containers, Dewars, Cocktails etc, by selecting from a drop-down list. Only select an entry if you have previously
        created an appropriate entry, or one already exists. Leave them blank otherwise. You can always edit the entries at
        a later time to create or change their associations. Furthermore, the MxLIVE interface provides powerful drag-and-drop
        features for associating entries with each other.
        
        To add multiple entries without closing a form, use the "Save and add another" button instead of the "Save" button.
