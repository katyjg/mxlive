After deploying do the following:

1. Run ./manage.py collectstatic (not needed with Docker)
2. Copy mxlive.crontasks to /etc/cron.d and edit it to make sure the path to
   manage.py and the interval is meaningful for the deployment (use docker exec with if using Docker)
3. Put server.key and server.crt into the local/certs directory or run the following command
   in the directory to generate self signed keys

   openssl req -nodes -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout server.key -out server.crt -days 356 -subj "/C=CA/ST=Saskatchewan/L=Saskatoon/O=CLS/CN=*.example.com"
